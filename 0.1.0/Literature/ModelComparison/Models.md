# LLaMA 3 (Meta, 70B)

Meta’s LLaMA 3 (70B) is a leading open LLM with powerful reasoning and long-context abilities. It uses a novel 128K-token positional encoding and grouped query attention to speed up inference, giving it support for extremely long inputs. In practice, LLaMA 3 excels at complex reasoning tasks: for example, a recent table-to-text study showed LLaMA 3 benefits markedly from few-shot prompting on structured data. Although specific CSV/header benchmarks haven’t been released, LLaMA 3 achieves state-of-the-art scores on broad reasoning benchmarks (e.g. math and logic) and is known for robust handling of messy inputs. Its size makes inference computationally heavy, but it consistently ranks near the top on open-model leaderboards for general tasks.

* **Context Window:** up to 128K tokens.
* **Benchmarks:** Top-tier on general reasoning; excels on table-to-text with few-shot prompts.

# Mistral (Mixtral MoE, 8×7B active, 46.7B total)

Mistral’s Mixtral 8×7B is a sparse Mixture-of-Experts model (46.7B total parameters, \~12.9B active) designed for efficiency and power. Official results show “Mixtral outperforms Llama 2 70B on most benchmarks with 6× faster inference”, even matching or beating GPT-3.5 on many tests. Mixtral handles up to 32K tokens at once and supports multiple languages. It is especially strong on coding and logical reasoning tasks (common proxies for tabular logic), and its sparse architecture (only 2 experts per token) means it achieves the speed/cost of a 12.9B model. Overall, Mixtral offers top-in-class performance for its size and very efficient inference, making it ideal for large, messy CSV files.

* **Context Window:** 32K tokens.
* **Performance:** Exceeds Llama 2-70B on standard benchmarks; excellent code/table reasoning.
* **Inference Efficiency:** \~6× faster than dense 70B; operates like a 12.9B model.

# Google Gemma 3 (12B)

Google’s Gemma 3 (12B) is a new open model family with advanced multimodal and multilingual capabilities. It explicitly supports a **128K-token context window**, allowing it to ingest entire long documents or CSVs. In head-to-head rankings, Gemma 3 has outperformed much larger LLMs: e.g. a Chatbot Arena evaluation gives Gemma 3 (27B) an Elo of 1338, above DeepSeek V3 and LLaMA 3-405B. Gemma 3 also supports structured output (function calling) to automate JSON/schema extraction. Google provides quantized versions of Gemma 3 for faster inference, making it more practical for large-batch tasks. In summary, Gemma 3’s huge context, state-of-the-art benchmarking in its size class, and efficiency optimizations strongly support its ability to find headers in noisy CSVs.

* **Context Window:** 128K tokens.
* **Structured Data:** Supports structured output and function calling for JSON/schema extraction.
* **Benchmarks:** Outperforms LLaMA 3-405B and others on human eval (LMArena Elo); quantized for speed.

# Google Gemma 1 (7B Instruct)

The original Gemma (7B Instruct) is a lightweight open model released by Google. It has an 8K token context window. Despite its small size, it achieves strong benchmark scores: for example, it scores \~64.6 on MMLU and **63.75** average on the open LLM Leaderboard. This outperforms other 7B-class models (e.g. Llama 2 7B, Mistral 7B) on general tasks. The 7B Gemma’s efficiency and free license make it a solid baseline. While it’s less capable than larger models, its strong relative performance suggests it can follow instructions and perform basic table/schema tasks moderately well.

* **Context Window:** 8K tokens.
* **Structured Data:** Achieves 63.75 on LLM benchmarks, outperforming other 7B models.
* **Notes:** Compact and open-source; good baseline for tabular tasks.

# Alibaba Qwen 2.5 (32B)

Alibaba’s Qwen 2.5 (e.g. 32B model) is explicitly optimized for tabular and structured-data tasks. According to Alibaba, Qwen 2.5 “understands structured data (such as tables)” and excels at generating structured outputs like JSON. In practice, some Qwen-2.5 variants support **extreme context lengths** (up to 1,000,000 tokens for Qwen2.5-14B), letting them read entire CSV files at once. Benchmarks and documentation highlight Qwen-2.5’s strength in JSON-schema generation and code/math reasoning. Combined with its large multilingual corpus and improved instruction-following, Qwen 2.5 consistently sets or ties state-of-the-art results among open models on schema/data extraction tasks. This makes it very well-suited for noisy CSV header inference.

* **Context Window:** Up to 1,000,000 tokens (Qwen2.5-14B variant).
* **Structured Data:** Trained for tables and JSON; “structured output” oriented.
* **Benchmarks:** SOTA on JSON/code tasks; improved instruction following and math.

# Microsoft Phi-3 (14B)

Microsoft’s Phi-3 (14B) is a “small” language model designed for efficiency. The Phi-3 medium model supports **128K** tokens, matching Gemma 3 in context length. On benchmarks, Microsoft reports Phi-3-small/medium *“significantly outperform \[models] of the same and larger sizes”*. In fact, Phi-3’s leaderboard shows it beating much larger GPT-3.5. Phi-3 is tailored for long-document reasoning (documents, code) and is highly optimized: variants support ONNX/DirectML for ultra-fast inference on GPUs/CPUs. Its small footprint means it can run on-device, yielding low latency. In sum, Phi-3 offers GPT-scale reasoning on tabular data with much lower cost, making it a strong candidate for large-scale CSV processing.

* **Context Window:** 128K tokens (Phi-3 Medium).
* **Structured Data:** Excels at math/reasoning; outperforms larger LMs on logic benchmarks.
* **Efficiency:** ONNX/DirectML optimized; very fast low-latency inference.

# DeepSeek R1 (≈14B distilled)

DeepSeek’s R1 models are specialized reasoning models trained via reinforcement learning. The DeepSeek-R1 family (with a 13–14B distilled model) achieves **expert-level logic/math performance**. In fact, DeepSeek-R1 (trained with multi-stage RL) “achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks”. The authors distill this into smaller models (including a 14B variant) to inherit its advanced logic capabilities. While not explicitly benchmarked on CSV tasks, its emphasis on latent reasoning suggests it could uncover non-obvious patterns (like obscured headers). Currently, DeepSeek models are research prototypes focused on deep logic, not yet widely tested on standard NLP benchmarks beyond math and code. Their inference efficiency is typical of a 13–14B model, but their novel training means they may generalize differently than other LLMs.

* **Context Window:** (Not specified; assume standard LLM limits.)
* **Structured Data:** Built for complex reasoning/math; rivaling GPT-3.5 on logic.
* **Notes:** Reinforcement-learning-trained; highly capable on novel reasoning tasks.

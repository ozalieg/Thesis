= Conclusions

This chapter distills the outcomes and operational insights gained from implementing and evaluating the Jayvee Template Generation and LLM-Based Schema Inference systems. It focuses on assessing system robustness, performance under scale, and the effectiveness of architectural decisions in addressing diverse data-processing challenges. Technical limitations and runtime behaviors are analyzed to surface lessons relevant to real-world deployment and reproducibility. These reflections consolidate the current state of the systems, serving as a foundation for ongoing refinement and future extension—discussed in detail in the subsequent Future Work section.

== Template Generation

The Jayvee template generation pipeline has matured into a robust, modular system capable of transforming diverse and often messy CSV schemas into executable Jayveepipelines at scale. The updated batch-driven architecture, powered by a SLURM-managed #abbr.a[HPC] setup, successfully processed 10,000 files without manual intervention and maintained sub-second generation latency per file.

Key robustness features—such as fallback renaming of unnamed columns, whitespace trimming, quoted field handling, and consistent CamelCase pipeline naming—ensure that input irregularities do not propagate downstream. Data type inference via pandas provides effective generalization across boolean, numeric, and text types, though datetime normalization remains a known limitation.

The system’s deterministic, file-based I/O and centralized logging strategy has enabled full automation,
observability, and testability.
While complex cases like multilingual headers and semantic null handling are not yet supported,
the current implementation offers a strong foundation for scaling and iterative enhancement.
Future iterations could integrate plugin support for custom block types and improve remote URL
handling for better security and extensibility.

== LLM-Based Schema Inference

The LLM-based schema inference module confirms the viability of transformer models
for detecting CSV header rows under real-world obfuscation conditions.
Although designed to evaluate a synthetic corpus of 10,000 noisy, variably structured files,
runtime instabilities—particularly CUDA out-of-memory and decoding errors—prevented full
execution across all models and files.
As a result, the findings presented here are derived from a systematic sampling of successful inference runs,
focusing on qualitative error modes and comparative trends observed in the subset that completed without exception.

=== Reflection and Technical Lessons Learned

Conducting this benchmark surfaced numerous hard-won lessons about working with large models in high-throughput environments. In hindsight, limited prior knowledge of #abbr.a[HPC] systems, memory management, multiprocessing paradigms, and GPU inference workflows introduced bottlenecks that could have been avoided with deeper system-level understanding. For example:

- I underestimated how quickly batch inference can exhaust GPU VRAM, especially under high token output settings or with non-streaming decoding.
- I lacked experience with CUDA-aware resource throttling, which led to repeated crashes and non-reproducible model behavior across runs.
- Early versions of the pipeline suffered from naive multiprocessing strategies,
spawning too many processes and overcommitting memory—issues that could have been resolved
with job-level granularity or tools like torchrun (even though I learned first hand torchrun
takes up a lot of memory too), accelerate, or more careful SLURM resource provisioning.
- I had not yet internalized how critical RAM-to-VRAM transfer overhead, disk I/O contention,
 and job isolation are for stable inference at scale.
- If I were to repeat this experiment now, I would restructure the pipeline with better
job-level fault isolation, adaptive batching, and tighter resource profiling.

More time and deeper familiarity with profiling tools like nvidia-smi, htop,
and nvprof would have enabled preventative diagnostics rather than reactive troubleshooting.
Additionally, I would adopt prompt freezing and output scoring ensembles earlier,
to mitigate the non-determinism of generative outputs in LLMs and ensure more consistent evaluation.

Despite these challenges, the modular, SLURM-parallelized evaluation harness proved invaluable in enabling traceable, partially reproducible experimentation under real-world constraints. These lessons now inform a clearer roadmap for scaling schema inference research with robustness and reproducibility in mind.
